# Creating this "blog"

When I sought out to create this blog I wanted it to be lightweight and simple first and foremost.
I think I did a pretty good job of that. I decided to use because see above and also its a pretty straight-
forward framework. I may end up deploying, but I may not. If I do it'll be located HERE.

# !!!IMPORTANT!!!

If you want to be able to display articles and files in the home and resources pages respectively, you'll need to create a directory called `articles` and `resources` in the root of your project.
To add files simply add basically whatever files or folders into the `resources` directory.
To add articles simply add them into the `articles` directory. To learn how to create articles so the
website properly displays them go to the [articles](#articles) section below.

# Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

# Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
